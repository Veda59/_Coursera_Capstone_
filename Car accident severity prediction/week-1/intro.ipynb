    "### Leveraging the tools and all the information nowadays available, an extensive analysis to predict tragic accidents and its severity would make a difference to the death toll. Analysing a signicant range of factors, including weather conditions, locality, type of road and lighting among others, an accurate prediction of the severity of the accidents can be performed. Thus, trends that commonly lead to severe incidents can help indentifying the highly severe accidents. This kind of information could be used by emergency services, to send the exact required sta and equipment to the place of the accident, leaving more resources available for accidents occurring simultaneously. Moreover, this severe accident situation can be warned to nearby hospitals which can have all the equipment ready for a severe intervention in advance, and thus saving countless lifes"
